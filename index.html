            <p class="about-me--text">At the grand age of 49 I decided I needed a change. Call it a mid-life crisis if you like, but something had to change.<br><br>I guess I've always had an interest in computers since way back in '82 when I would write little games on my brothers Sinclair ZX Spectrum in BASIC. Nothing fancy of course but fun none-the-less. I've always enjoyed designing too so I guess that kind of led me to here, Web Developer, well not quite yet, but on the path.<br><br>For the last 12 months I have been learning the craft, watching YouTube videos or Udemy Courses, and now I'm studying the Front-End Engineer Career Path on Codecademy (and loving it).<br><br>I'm 50 now and firm believer that this old dog can definitely learn new tricks!</p>

            <p class="skills--text">I've have learned quite a lot over the last year, forgotten a bit too - thank god for MDN!<br><br>Although I would never profess to be an expert in any of these skills, I can say that I have a very good understanding of HTML & CSS - semantics, DRY coding, CSS variables & units etc. My JavaScript is also coming along but I definitely have a lot more to learn on that.<br><br>I have dabled with Node.js during my studies (mostly on Udemy) and I would say my Git/Git Hub knowledge is somewhat limited at the moment but I am practising more with this and I am getting better.</p>
